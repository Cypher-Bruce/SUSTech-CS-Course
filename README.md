# SUSTech-CS-Course

## Introduction

I'm a SUSTech Turing Class student of grade 2022 majored in Computer Science and Technology.
This repo is a collection of course materials, assignments, projects, and review notes from my courses at SUSTech.
I hope this repo can help you with your study, but please be sure to follow the  Academic Integrity Policy of SUSTech.

## Repo Structure

I will try to keep the structure of each course folder consistent, as follows:

| **Folder Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lecture Slides** | Lecture slides/notes from BlackBoard |
| **Lab Exercise** | Lab related files |
| **Assignment** | Course assignment. I include most of my submissions in the folder as well, but they may be inaccurate. The official answer will be presented in the same folder if available. |
| **Project** | Project code, report and presentation |
| **Midterm/Final Review** | Review notes |

## To Non-turing Students
For those who are not Turing students, you may find some info missing or not consistent with your course.
In that case, I suggest you refer to [SUSTech Course Info](https://github.com/NYH-Dolphin/SUSTech-Course-Info) from [NYH](https://github.com/NYH-Dolphin), or [SUSTech CSE Final Reviews](https://github.com/RoderickQiu/SUSTech_CSE_Final_Reviews) and [SUSTech CSE Projects](https://github.com/RoderickQiu/SUSTech_CSE_Projects) from [Roderick](https://github.com/RoderickQiu).

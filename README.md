# SUSTech-CS-Course
## Intro
Good to see you.
I'm a SUSTech Turing Class student of grade 2022 majored in Computer Science and Technology.
And I hope this repo can help you do better in CS as well.

This is a repo for SUSTech Computer Science course related files.
Most courses are CS courses, while the others are CS related courses (for example Probability and Statistics).

## What do we have here?
| **Folder Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lecture Slides** | Lecture slides/notes from BlackBoard |
| **Lab Exercise** | Lab related files |
| **Assignment** | Course assignment. To be noticed that I include most of my submissions in the assgiment folder as well, but they may be inaccurate. I already put the official solution in the same folder to avoid confusion if it is provided. |
| **Project** | Project code, report and presentation |
| **Midterm/Final Review** | Review notes(probably most helpful) |

## In the end
Since I'm a turing class student, some course info might not apply to similar non-turing course.
In this case, I suggest you refer to [SUSTech-Course-Info](https://github.com/NYH-Dolphin/SUSTech-Course-Info) provided by [NYH](https://github.com/NYH-Dolphin).

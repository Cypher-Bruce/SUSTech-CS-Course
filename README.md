# SUSTech-CS-Course
## Intro :
Good to see you.
I'm a SUSTech Turing Class student of grade 2022 majored in Computer Science and Technology.
And I hope this repo can help you do better in CS as well.

This is a repo for SUSTech Computer Science course related files.
Most courses are CS courses, while the others are CS related courses (for example Probability and Statistics).

## Repo Structure
| **Folder Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lecture Slides** | Lecture slides/notes from BlackBoard |
| **Lab Exercise** | Lab related files |
| **Assignment** | Course assignment. To be noticed that I include most of my submissions in the assgiment folder as well, but they may be inaccurate. The official version will be put in the same folder to avoid confusion, if it is provided. |
| **Project** | Project code, report and presentation |
| **Midterm/Final Review** | Review notes(probably most helpful) |

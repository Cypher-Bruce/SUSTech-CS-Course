response benjus wald 's comment ( 8 . 736 , disc ) functionalism : fear talk little cross-purposes here . main interest clarify position natural phonology issue so-cal contradictory process . benjus seem little focus question means call something " cluster " phonetic term . < delete : elaboration nature phonetic cluster , particularly [ pt ] > > > question , remember correctly , > > why speaker able pronounce reduce [ pt ] > > n't pronounce unreduce one . > > view above , understand phonological > process involve consciously controllable , reduction ( > whatever ? ) first vowel " potato " reflect process normally > occur speech deliberate conscious , > relatively spontaneous .

gotcha ! two separate fallacy argument against n-ary comparison discuss recently power , delancey , guy apparently seek defend . ( 1 ) janhunen probability match occur purely chance compare japanese four language four compare one language . simply cannot true probability value between 0 1 . probablity case binary comparison . 5 , predict 2 case n-ary comparison , impossible , 2 between 0 1 . ( 2 ) fallacy purely mathematical , although suspect involve element confusio . case , one argue n-ary comparison ever talk match 2 n language . , guy 's number , scenario 100 - word list shift meaning , 14 . 5 probable spurious mathce binary comparison 5 . 8 match between 3 5 language , 0 . 13 one between 4 5 , much smaller number yet case 5 5 . sure jacque define spurious verify number , certainly right order magnitude . consider language ( initial probability match decline , usually happen toy model real datum ) , happen need fewer fewer n language compare agree . thus , guy 's example match between n - 2 language 5 less likely occur chance one between 2 2 . n 100 , . e . , compare 100 language , need n - 2 ( . e . , 98 ) language agree able better binary comparison . many many fewer ( although n't many since formula jacque assume initial probability match ) . maybe , kindly supply number . light , let us add another argument reject indo - european : bopp never offer mathematical demonstration relationship propose unlikely due chance , much less binary comparison every pair indo - european language . show unrealistic whole idea comparison . want , least let us clear minimize false positive ( . e . match due chance really reflective common origin ) false negative ( . e . , failure genuine historical connection ) . second point , argument n-ary better . alexis mr

review anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ lorium . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book introduction work during past few both representation eventuality temporal reason . book combine approach 's desire lose information previously discourse semantic principle squarely base situation semantic . allow introduce dynamic aspect tree ( dats ) , loosely describe temporal inference pump . ter meulen point , though common sense reason play important role temporal reason , aim deal . finally present paperback edition book incorporate appendix exercise dat construction short account resemblance difference between drt dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aim account linguistic informational balance between static dynamic information , propose abstract semantic principle relative tense aspect tool derive situation semantic . 1 . introduction language describe world compose two main type temporal object : event introduce change state . linguistic capacity accompany inferential ability interpretation case . ter meulen deal simple past , perfect , progressive present , tense indicate order event occur , through weak constraint temporal relation between event . difference between simple past perfect aspectual , obvious examine light difference between event state : simple past describe event context-dependent while perfect stative information . aspect impose control flow information here ter meulen introduce three main universal aspectual class , hole , filter plug closely relate , respectively , vendler 's classical ontological class activity ( " john run half hour " ) , accomplishment ( " john build house " ) achievement ( " john win race " ) . ter meulen introduce notion situate reason : accord , temporal vantage point text reason text proceed . first ( descriptive ) factor . second ( aspectual ) factor source information , while third factor perspective information . temporal information process against context ( ) incorporate least lexicon syntax language , situate logical inference rule , semantic constraint ( presupposition ) , available information element situation . 2 . aspectual verb aspectual verb describe internal structure event , english , " start " , " begin " , " commence " , " initiate " , " resume " ( event beginning ) , " continue " , " keep " ( event middle ) " end " , " finish " , " terminate " , " halt " , " cease " , " complete " ( event ending ) . aspectual verb describe middle end event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumption previous existence event , event ) . aspectual verb describe onset event semantically indefinite existential character . verb describe middle event quantificational verb hole . verb describe end event filter plug depend whether finish ( plug ) end ( hole ) . pair aspectual verb link semantic contrary relation , " start / finish " , " stop / resume " , " resume / finish " , " keep / end " , " continue / end " . dat 's , event complex object , constitute individual , relation positive negative polarity . event classify similarity class type base part . type consist relation , object positive negative polarity , indicate whether relation hold hold between object . type include parameter indeterminate object constituent apart polarity . situation support type match constituent . type include parameter ( parametric type ) , support depend existence situation object correspond parameter satisfy both relation polarity . aspectual verb describe term monotonicity : inference , aspectual verb , valid smaller part larger part , verb monotone increase , while inference valid larger part smaller part , verb monotone decrease . ter meulen propose aspectual cube , cube allow representation relation between aspectual verb monotonicity property . each vortex cube two vertical arrow first represent dynamic plug ( upward arrow ) / static hole ( downward arrow ) while second represent increase ( upward arrow ) decrease ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . cube visualize dynamic transition begin + start ; stop " end " " finish " . bottom correspond stative hole , while top correspond dynamic plug , allow four combination arrow english : dynamic plug + increase monotonicity , dynamic plug + decrease monotonicity , stative hole + increase monotonicity , stative hole + descrease monotonicity . external negation flip leave arrow change dynamicity , while internal negation flip right arrow . finally , arrow kinematic , whereby combination arrow above dynamic stative aspect , alway determine right arrow ( . e . value combination alway value right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect tree ( dats ) dats graphically represent information event direct graph where node , label descriptive information , either hole plug . each dat unique source node ( plug ) , rightmost terminal node , correspond utterance event determine perspective . information past tense precede source represent node branch leave . present information include source . thus left-to - right order represent flow while downward arrow represent temporal inclusion . dats temporal reason past ( though allow modality counterfactual ) . dat single root node , dominate node , include source , represent entire episode describe . current node , construct one open ( hole ) close ( plug ) , property determine next information process . current node plug , information represent node descend one current node 's parent node , usually lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clause introduce node , while state , quantificational relation , perfect clause " " progressive clause introduce sticker current node , plug , next node , hole . sticker portable transmit node dat grow . introduce node independent current one indicate change perspective . path connect set label node root chronoscope current chronoscope one contain current node . compatibility relation ( symmetric , reflexive transitive ) determine both lexically through entailment relation between type same chronoscope . notion chronoscope one main device temporal reason dats , allow persistence , . e . preservation information . however , temporal reason depend current node , search conclusion start current node . dats structure semantic object rather linguistic expression , follow semantic rule . interpret event structure embed allow temporal reason obey semantic constraint . interpretability text depend possibility construct dat embed event structure obey constraint . embed dat describe episode event structure embed provide value . text true episode describe dat part world . 4 . state , generic information constraint stative information alway represent sticker node dats , state permanent , difference represent portability condition perspective shift . thus rule downward portability condition sticker portability condition accommodation . portability condition differ perfect state progressive state . generic stative information represent sticker import upward depend whether property predicate under default member category whether predicate category itself rather member whether appear conditional under temporal quantification . 5 . perspective dat certain perspective episode describe same episode describe different dats , each different perspective . means dats same episode lead different conclusion . change perspective depend rule update : hole sticker rule change perspective , plug filler rule . word , change chronoscope correspond change perspective depend status current node . , however , perspective create chronoscope update dat : possibility through perspective refinement . perspective refinement correspond unplug plug turn hole , allow addition information under . notion perspective strongly dependent compatibility information , generally , coherence one merit dat allow precise content rather slippery notion coherence , relie rule dat construction notion chronoscope . perspective refinement usually correspond flashback consist three operation : unplug node old chronoscope , reset current node old one exist node node add independent though dominate same ancestor . ter meulen propose tentative definition flashback process . note perspective allow perspective bind np anaphora propose perspective constraint deal . finally ter meulen outline possibility three-dimensional dats , third dimension allow representation independent structure node , though communality root preserve . three dimensional dats call scenario though each part dats unique source still describe episode . part scenario incorporate different simultaneous episode scene . 6 . fragment english chapter , ter meulen syntactic semantic account fragment english , " laboratory environment theory interpretation " ( 93 ) , recapitulation rule dat construction update . 7 . epilogue dats allow simultaneous encode three type information : aspectual control information through open / close property node , temporal part / whole relation between event , descriptive information through type label node . dats compatible aristotelian realism define barwise perry , , view structure information depend natural world . distinction , accord ter meulen between interpret utterance extract information contain evaluate truth-value information . appendix appendix add paperback edition , ter meulen provide exercise dat construction comparison between drt dats . comment second part appendix . ter meulen note , dats stem partly drt . nevertheless though dat logic develop enough allow complete comparison , quite few difference between : dats account inference simple past past perfect progressive , portability condition stative information chronoscope aspectual verb , drt ; drt account temporal adverbial temporal interpretation subordinate clause , dats ; dats substitute notion current chronoscope notion temporal reference point drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference depend crucially current node , while drt characterize valid logic inference classically , logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book highly stimulate , original interest . must read anyone interest , tense aspect . criticism level against one reason : fact book much too short . means though clear enough , rather difficult read . quite frustrate , instance , though ter meulen explain construct dats ( chapter 3 ) detail rule , enough step step example dats book ( example , kamp reyle 1993 ) . much same , one much detail comparison alternative account , drt , parsonian account event , generally , aktionsart . appendix , add paperback edition ( 1997 ) exist first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , really enough satisfy both complaint . ter meulen 's book hint relation between reference object reference ( indefiniteness argument nps verb influence interpretation clause , , notably , aspect ) . hint interest , again , longer book author scope develop those intuition . thus one hope interest book follow bigger one , dat logic develop fully , contrast alternative approach where ter meulen describe precisely suggestion regard perspective interaction between semantic aspect dats commonsense reason whose necessity acknowledge deal book . finally , ter meulen 's book publish same pustejovsky 's work lexicon , thus n't pustejovsky 's system . nice intersection between approach .

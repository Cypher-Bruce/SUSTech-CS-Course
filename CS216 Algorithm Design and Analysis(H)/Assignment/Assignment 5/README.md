# The requirements for this assignment are as follows:
## In class, we learned several max-flow algorithms. In the lab assignment, we learned how to extend them to find the min-cost max flows. We also learned several max-flow applications, e.g., bipartite matching. So, if the bipartite matching problem has costs, one can find min-cost max matching by converting it to a min-cost max-flow problem. However, a min-cost max-flow algorithm (that we learned so far) requires O(mnk) time, where k is the cardinality of the max matching. Can we find a more efficient algorithm to solve the min-cost max-matching problem in a bipartite graph? In this assignment, you are asked to learn and describe an efficient algorithm known as the Hungarian or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, which finds a min-cost perfect matching in O(n^3) time. Please read Section 7.13 of your textbook and do the following:
1. Write the pseudocode for this algorithm. Please provide sufficient details, e.g., how the prices are maintained and how the reduced costs are calculated.
2. Explain your pseudocode by describing the core idea and critical procedures.
3. Analyze the correctness, running time, and space complexity of the algorithm.
4. Formulate a max-cost max-matching problem as a min-cost perfect-matching problem. Explain the correctness of your formulation, i.e., why it works.

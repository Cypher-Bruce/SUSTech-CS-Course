    "The class `PropKB` can be used to represent a knowledge base of propositional logic sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the class `KB` has four methods, apart from `__init__`. A point to note here: the `ask` method simply calls the `ask_generator` method. Thus, this one has already been implemented, and what you'll have to actually implement when you create your own knowledge base class (though you'll probably never need to, considering the ones we've created for you) will be the `ask_generator` function and not the `ask` function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PropKB` now.\n",
    "* `__init__(self, sentence=None)` : The constructor `__init__` creates a single field `clauses` which will be a list of all the sentences of the knowledge base. Note that each one of these sentences will be a 'clause' i.e. a sentence which is made up of only literals and `or`s.\n",
    "* `tell(self, sentence)` : When you want to add a sentence to the KB, you use the `tell` method. This method takes a sentence, converts it to its CNF, extracts all the clauses, and adds all these clauses to the `clauses` field. So, you need not worry about `tell`ing only clauses to the knowledge base. You can `tell` the knowledge base a sentence in any form that you wish; converting it to CNF and adding the resulting clauses will be handled by the `tell` method.\n",
    "* `ask_generator(self, query)` : The `ask_generator` function is used by the `ask` function. It calls the `tt_entails` function, which in turn returns `True` if the knowledge base entails query and `False` otherwise. The `ask_generator` itself returns an empty dict `{}` if the knowledge base entails query and `None` otherwise. This might seem a little bit weird to you. After all, it makes more sense just to return a `True` or a `False` instead of the `{}` or `None` But this is done to maintain consistency with the way things are in First-Order Logic, where an `ask_generator` function is supposed to return all the substitutions that make the query true. Hence the dict, to return all these substitutions. I will be mostly be using the `ask` function which returns a `{}` or a `False`, but if you don't like this, you can always use the `ask_if_true` function which returns a `True` or a `False`.\n",
    "* `retract(self, sentence)` : This function removes all the clauses of the sentence given, from the knowledge base. Like the `tell` function, you don't have to pass clauses to remove them from the knowledge base; any sentence will do fine. The function will take care of converting that sentence to clauses and then remove those."

    "- Definite clauses can be written as implications:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The most important simplification a definite clause provides is that it can be written as an implication.\n",
    "The premise (or the knowledge that leads to the implication) is a conjunction of positive literals.\n",

    "The sentence thus becomes easier to understand.\n",

    "The SAT problem was the first problem to be proven _NP-complete_.\n",

    "This algorithm is very similar to Backtracking-Search.\n",

    "1. Early termination:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In certain cases, the algorithm can detect the truth value of a statement using just a partially completed model.\n",
    "For example, $(P\\lor Q)\\land(P\\lor R)$ is true if P is true, regardless of other variables.\n",
    "This reduces the search space significantly.\n",
    "2. Pure symbol heuristic:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A symbol that has the same sign (positive or negative) in all clauses is called a _pure symbol_.\n",
    "It isn't difficult to see that any satisfiable model will have the pure symbols assigned such that its parent clause becomes _true_.\n",
    "For example, $(P\\lor\\neg Q)\\land(\\neg Q\\lor\\neg R)\\land(R\\lor P)$ has P and Q as pure symbols\n",

    "3. Unit clause heuristic:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the context of DPLL, clauses with just one literal and clauses with all but one _false_ literals are called unit clauses.\n",

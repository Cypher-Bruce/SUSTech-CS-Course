# The requirements for this assignment are as follows:
## In class, we learned how to construct polynomial-time reductions between problems with three simple examples. In your textbook, there are several more involved reduction examples. In this assignment, you are asked to pick your favorite one from the following problems and write the proofs in detail. Most proofs are shown in the textbook (Sections 8.5-8.8), but you must write them in your own words. Please describe the problem that you picked in sufficient details.
1. 3-SAT ≤ p Traveling-Salesman
2. 3-SAT ≤ p 3D-Matching
3. 3-SAT ≤ p 3-Color
4. 3-SAT ≤ p Knapsack

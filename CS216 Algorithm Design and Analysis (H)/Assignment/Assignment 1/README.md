# The requirements for this assignment are as follows:
## In this assignment, you are required to apply the learned knowledge to analyze the extended Gale-Shapley algorithm used for Lab2B College Admission. Please briefly describe the extended GS algorithm where students apply to colleges, then answer the following questions:

1. What is its time complexity (running time) and space complexity (memory) in big O notation?
2. Define stable matching for this college admission setting. Note that now we allow one-to-many matching (e.g., one college may accept multiple students) and incomplete preference lists (e.g., some colleges may be unacceptable to a student, or vice versa). Does the extended GS algorithm output a stable matching? Prove or disprove it.
3. Define student-optimal matching. Does the above student-applying GS algorithm produce the student-optimal matching? Prove or disprove it.

# The requirements for this assignment are as follows:
We learned in class that the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is designed to efficiently compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) (and its inverse) of a sequence. FFT is an extremely popular algorithm with tons of applications.

In this assignment, you are asked to write a report to describe your favorite FFT applications. The goal of this assignment is for you to explore practical applications of an important algorithm, systematize the learned knowledge, and express it in a clear way.

Again, your report will be graded based on quality, e.g., clarity, scope, coherence, conciseness, technicality, etc. Besides, we will consider the importance of your selected FFT applications. We expect your report to capture the motivation and high-level ideas of at least 5 applications, and 2 of them should be described in sufficient technical detail (e.g., including proofs if any).

Note: You are encouraged to introduce variants of the learned FFT and discuss their applications. Such applications are, of course, counted towards the above required applications.
